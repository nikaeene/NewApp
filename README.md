# newapp
A News APP is developing and learning by Ehsan Nikaeen.

## Getting Started
This is an app for bunch of tutorials. My main goal was to train myself and get a deeper knowledge in Dart and Flutter, and then maybe help the others have some better solution for coding.

## First Series: Building an offline NewsApp from an API

In this series of tutorials, I want to go step by step to make a NewsApp by calling an API, parsing the data, putting it in a database, and then reading the data from the database!

All these steps separately may use in different situations and because of that, I will write them in 4 articles.
One, Calling an API properly with state management and error handling. 
Two, Modeling the rough data. Three, create the database and put the data in it. 
Four, read the data and show it in UI.

## Second series:A journey to Machine Learning in Flutter
ML
I am trying to go through ML from basics and have comprehensive learning for myself and you in Flutter.
I have experience in ML and used TensorFlow and TFlite before. But I want to expand it and make it a reliable skill.
I will start as someone who doesn't know anything and cover flaws in my knowledge that may exist or progress I may not be aware of.


I wrote articles over this repository and for every commits there would be an article in my Linkedin. You can find details in my Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ehsan-nikaeen-b01641194/
