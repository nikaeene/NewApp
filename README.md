A News APP.

## Getting Started
This is an app for tutorial.

In this series of tutorials, I want to go step by step to make a NewsApp by calling an API, parsing the data, putting it in a database, and then reading the data from the database!

All these steps separately may use in different situations and because of that, I will write them in 4 articles.
One, Calling an API properly with state management and error handling. 
Two, Modeling the rough data. Three, create the database and put the data in it. 
Four, read the data and show it in UI.
